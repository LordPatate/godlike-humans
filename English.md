## English version (translation)

This is a work of fiction.

Let us imagine that humanity comes to an agreement.

Countries start cooperating and governments become democratic. Conflicts cease.
Individual profit stops driving the economy, allowing social classes to disappear.
Thanks to technological advancements and everyone's efforts, the ecological disaster is avoided.

Almost everything now becomes possible. Which quickly brings us to ask ourselves: what to do next?

Once the obvious problems solved (insecurity, biodiversity, global warming, cancer...),
 humanity reaches the point to which its existence is no longer threatened. At all.
There are no more danger, life can peacefully... continue.

What next?

The quest for knowledge becomes humanity's sole purpose. Knowing everything, understanding everything.
With no other objective of higher priority than the maintenance of an ecosystem necessary for its survival, humanity considerably accelerate scientific progress.

Soon, the solar system is entirely explored, all of the sun's energy harnessed, interstellar travel made possible.

In order to adapt to the cosmic scale of their new playground, humans evolve, increasing their lifespan, developing
 their skills.

"Humanity" now names a super-organism constituted by the many individuals that can no longer be classified as part of
 the *homo sapiens* species. This super-organism is, through the collective action of its members, capable of thinking,
 pondering, desiring, deciding and, obviously, acting.

Its actions have an impact on an interstellar scale. By its action, humanity explores a galaxy, understands the working
 of the universe, forges a star.

Finally comes the inevitable: humanity comes to the end of its quest. It learned everything, understood everything, or
 knows that it won't learn any more, that the last hypotheses can never be verified.

What next?

If, in its quest, no revelation have already shaken humanity to the point where it wants to forget what it just
 learned; it will be facing this ultimate barrier where curiosity ends that it will stop.
Then, it might chose to stay here for a while. The universe still has some time ahead, so there is no rush. Just like
 they who reached the top of the cliff, who just before climbing down, takes the time to admire the landscape one last
 time.

What next?

Whether it's to forget an unsettling truth and regain the bliss of ignorance, or to be able to relive the adventure
 as if it was the first time again, or maybe simply out of nostalgia; humanity decides to forget. To start afresh.

That implies considerable work, the greatest ever undertook. It consists in going back to a single species, on a single
 planet, with no scientific knowledge, in a custom-made world, an utopia of simplicity and ignorance.
Aware of the fact that it leaves behind the trace of a prodigious cosmic adventure, a bit of cleaning is done.
Some of its creations are destroyed, erased or hidden, to prevent memories from resurfacing.
Other creations are left as they are, because quite frankly, in the state of ignorance in which the human beings will
 be brought back, they will never consider that they were behind it.

The last thing to setup before proceeding to the collective oblivion is to plant the seeds of beliefs that will allow
 to come up with simple explanations for all the great questions that stimulated scientific curiosity the first time.

What next?

Thus, God made man in its image, and forbid it the fruit of knowledge.

You already know what's next.
